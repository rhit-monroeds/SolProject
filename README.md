continuous.py or old_continuous.py will work best for you. Run both to see which one works for your computer.

This script uses the solscan.io API to scan transfers from popular exchanges and track what the reciever does with the recently transferred funds. It is optimized to find insiders who are buying coins early before they become popular. By backtesting this script, I saw that it would have found RTR, DJT, and more tokens before they were at 2 million market cap. RTR went to 130 million and DJT went to over 400 million.

Have fun
